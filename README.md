# Fair Share - Bill Splitting

A full-stack expense sharing application built as an experiment in AI-assisted development. This project demonstrates how modern AI tools can be leveraged to create production-quality applications, with strategic human oversight.

## About the Project

This application helps groups track and split shared expenses. Users can:
- Create and manage expense groups
- Add members to groups
- Record expenses with flexible splitting options
- Track balances and settlements
- Support multiple currencies

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Storage)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + CSS Variables for theming
- **State Management**: React Hooks + Context
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Zod

## AI-Assisted Development

This project was primarily developed using various AI tools, showcasing the potential of AI-assisted development: 

- **WindSurf**
- **Cursor**
- **GitHub Copilot**

While AI tools generated most of the code, human intervention was used for:
- Tech-stack, Architecture decisions
- Code review and quality control
- Edge case handling
- User experience refinements

## Key Features

- 🔐 Secure authentication
- 👥 Group management
- 💰 Expense tracking
- ⚖️ Multiple split options (equal, exact amounts, shares)
- 💱 Multi-currency support
- 📊 Balance calculations
- 🎨 Clean, responsive UI

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up Supabase project and add environment variables
4. Run migrations: `npm run migrate`
5. Start development server: `npm run dev`
